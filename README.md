# Rhine-River-SSC
Code used for the graduation research into the decreasing suspended sediment concentrations of the Rhine River using the Goolge Earth Engine. Geemap was used to create this code in the python api.



The "LANDSAT_SSC" file shows the code that was used to export the SSC values of the merged Landsat image collection for the Lobith sampling location.
The "SENTINEL_SSC" file shows the code that was used to export the SSC values of the Setinel image collection for the Lobith sampling location.

The "Cartoee_Sentinel" file shows the code that allows for the creation of a timelapse with the SSC data. This data was not used in the study, code is now working for its intended purpose.
